# ICP Tools Global Mapping

## Overview

The ICP tools are a collection of ROS packages used for the ICP-based localization and mapping.
The package ``icp_tools`` contains a ROS node wrapping around [libpointmatcher](https://github.com/ANYbotics/libpointmatcher).
The contained node can be controlled using the an RQT-based GUI ``rqt_icp``.

### Overview

Inverse Kinematics Control: This package provides a module that computes joint positions and joint velocities through inverse kinematics and inverse differential kinematics. 
The module can be used as impedance controller or as alight-weight stand-alone tracking controller. In the latter case, joint torques are set to zero and the joint control modes are overwritten.

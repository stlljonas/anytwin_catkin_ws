**An Architecture for the Versatile Control of Legged Robots**

*Free Gait* is a software framework for the versatile, robust, and task-oriented control of legged robots. The Free Gait interface defines a *whole-body abstraction layer* to accommodate a variety of task-space control commands such as end effector, joint, and base motions. The deﬁned motion tasks are tracked with a feedback whole-body controller to ensure accurate and robust motion execution even under slip and external disturbances. The application of this framework includes intuitive tele-operation of the robot, efficient scripting of behaviors, and fully autonomous operation with motion and footstep planners.

| Motions are based on a combination of (possibly multiple) leg motions and a base motion per command (step). | The command structure allows to control legged robots in various ways. | Motion  goals  are  commanded  through  the  Free  Gait  API  to  the whole-body  motion  controller. |

## Usage

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZvCCOmD8) presents an overview over the tools provided in Free Gait.

### Free Gait Actions

Free Gait actions are libraries and scripts that define motions using the Free Gait API (for ROS ). For ROS, these actions can be write in any language with a ROS client library using the message and action definitions in *[free_gait_msgs]*. For C++, Free Gait provides the *[free_gait_core]* library to work with motion definitions and the *[free_gait_ros]* for interfacing ROS. To work with Python, use the *[free_gait_python]* library. For simple motion definitions, Free Gait supports actions defined in [YAML] format. For more information about using YAML actions, refer to [YAML Scripting Interface](#yaml-scripting-interface).

Free Gait commands are expressed as a combination of leg (in joint or end-effector Cartesian space) and base motions with definition of position, velocity, and/or force/torque targets or trajectories.

|  | Target | Trajectory | Automatic |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Leg motion in joint space | [JointTarget](free_gait_msgs/msg/JointTarget.msg) | [JointTrajectory](free_gait_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory.msg) | [LegMode](free_gait_msgs/msg/LegMode.msg) |
| Leg motion in Cartesian space | [EndEffectorTarget](free_gait_msgs/msg/EndEffectorTarget.msg) | [EndEffectorTrajectory](free_gait_msgs/msg/EndEffectorTrajectory.msg) | [Footstep](free_gait_msgs/msg/Footstep.msg) |
| Base motion | [BaseTarget](free_gait_msgs/msg/BaseTarget.msg) | [BaseTrajectory](free_gait_msgs/msg/BaseTrajectory.msg) | [BaseAuto](free_gait_msgs/msg/BaseAuto.msg) |

Free Gait actions can be either launched manually or with help of the *[free_gait_action_loader]*.

### Free Gait Action Loader

The *[free_gait_action_loader]* allows to launch actions through a [ROS service](free_gait_msgs/srv/SendAction.srv) or [ROS action](free_gait_msgs/action/ExecuteAction.action). Currently, the action loader supports *YAML* motion definitions, *Python* scripts, and starting *ROS launch files* for *C++* and other libraries.

Run the *[free_gait_action_loader]* with

	rosrun free_gait_action_loader action_loader.py

The *[free_gait_action_loader]* manages the actions and makes sure that only one action is running at the time. To register an action with the *[free_gait_action_loader]*, one has to load the action as a ROS plugin.

### RQT Free Gait Action

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZvCCOmD8"><img align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/sy91C8f.gif"></a>

The *[rqt_free_gait_action]* package provides a [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt) user interface to the  *[free_gait_action_loader]*. The interface shows the actions organized in *collections* and allows to preview and send the actions. Additionally, collections can be run as sequence of actions and with a right-click, a collection can be selected as favorite. Favorites are shown as buttons on the top for quick access.

### RQT Free Gait Monitor

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZvCCOmD8"><img align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/vIW2fjj.gif"></a>

Once actions are being executed by the *[Free Gait action server](free_gait_ros/include/free_gait_ros/FreeGaitActionServer.hpp)*, the *[rqt_free_gait_monitor]* shows the progress of the execution and allows to pause and stop the active action.

### Free Gait RViz Plugin

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZvCCOmD8"><img align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/GUqRKD4.gif"></a>

Actions can be previewed with the *[free_gait_rviz_plugin]*. It takes the current state of the robot and visualizes the motion based on the defined action. This [RViz] plugin allows to scrub through time and visualize footholds, trajectories, support polygons etc.

### YAML Scripting Interface

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZvCCOmD8"><img align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/N9L6ogg.gif"></a>

For simple motion sequences, Free Gait actions can be defined as  a sequence of [YAML] definitions.

For example, this action lifts the right-fore leg of the robot:

    adapt_coordinates:
     - transform:
        source_frame: footprint
        target_frame: odom

    steps:
     - step:
       - base_auto:
     - step:
       - base_auto:
       - end_effector_target:
          name: RF_LEG
          ignore_contact: true
          target_position:
           frame: footprint
           position: [0.39, -0.22, 0.20]

The `adapt_coordinates` command transforms motions defined in the `source_frame` to the `target_frame`.

## FAQ

### Actions Are Not Found

If no Free Gait actions are found/loaded, this service call will return empty:

	rosservice call /free_gait_action_loader/list_actions "collection_id: ''"

In this case, try [initializing rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep#Initializing_rosdep) with:

	sudo rosdep init
	rosdep update

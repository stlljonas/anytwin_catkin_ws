 * Overload ostream operator<< for convenient use with the AverageCalculator class.

 * for acces to its members. In addition, when deriving from AverageCalculator, this would leave us with all advantages of
 * polymorphism, since, for a different output, one would only need to override the toString() member function.
 * Note 2: The inline specifier is required to let the linker (which would otherwise throw an error) know that it is okay
 * that this header-only function may appear in multiple translation units. However, it does not determine whether the
 * compiler will inline the function.
